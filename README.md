# Scala UI Test Refactoring Challenge

Welcome to the UI Test Refactoring Challenge!
This challenge is based on the MoT automation week refactoring challenge.

This challenge is all about creating clean, readable and maintainable code. 
[RefactoringChallengeTests.scala](src/test/scala/RefactoringChallengeTests.scala)
contains five tests that work (just about) but require cleaning up. Update this code base
so that it's easier to maintain, more readable, and has sensible ways of asserting
data.


**Hint:** *You might want to research different approaches to improving UI automation such as
Page Object Models and implicit vs. explicit waits, as well as features that might make things
easier to maintain*
